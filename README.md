# [Project 2: Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts.ipynb)
In this project we will explor data from [Hacker News Posts](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

We will take a look at two types of posts whoes titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?". Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.
