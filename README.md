# Dominik Zalewski Portfolio
Hi,
I'm Dominik and welcome to my portoflio website. You can find some data science projects. If you're interesting in one of them, just click on header to show whole project on my GitHub. Thanks for time! Enjoy :)

# [Project 15: 
Creating first machine learing model - Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Car%20Prices.ipynb)
In this guided project, we'll practice the machine learning workflow, using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. We'll build model which will predcit car prices.

# [Project 14: Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Winning%20Jeopardy.ipynb)
Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture.

Let's imagine that you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any way to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.

# [Project 13: Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Baye.ipynb)
Nobody likes recieving spam. These kind of messages are very annoying. Using spam filter in our e-mail is commonly using and it very usefull thing. However, we may also got spam on our moblie phone by unwanted text message. In this guided project, we will analysys the dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. Our task is to "teach" the computer how to classify messages. To do that, we'll use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

# [Project 12: Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission310Solutions.ipynb)
Let's assume that we're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

# [Project 11: Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Fandango_ratings.ipynb)
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator).

Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars. Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

# [Project 10: Chinook Records Store Database - Answering Business Questions using SQL](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Chinook_sql.ipynb)
In this project we will be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - a smaller version of iTunes.

The database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and their purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. Here is a schema diagram for the Chinook database:

# [Project 8: Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Star%20Wars.ipynb)
In this project we're going to explore dataset of Star Wars Survey, which contains respondetns' answers about Star Wars. The survey has been carried out on July 2014 (before the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and all data was collected by FiveThirtyEight team to answer on following question: "does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?"

Our aim is to answer on question about. We'll also try to find any interesting patterns.

# [Project 6: Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Clean%20And%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb)
In this guided project, we will take a look on employee exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

Our aim is to answer on following questions:
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

# [Project 5: Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/EURO_PLN%20and%20EURO_USD%20plots%20(2).ipynb)
We will take a look at data set with Daily Exchange Rates per Euro 1999-2021. We can find here comparison to most of world currencies.

We will create 2 plots using matplotlib library, one with currency fluctuations during financial crisis and COVID-19 in EURO/USD and second one in EURO/PLN.

# [Project 4: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Finding%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators%20on%20I-94.ipynb)
The project is devoted to examiane traffic on I-94 Interstate highway which connecting the Great Lakes and northern Great Plains regions of the United States.

The goal of analysis is to find some indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. If they are, we'll try to find a correlation and check if they have influnce on traffic increase. We will focus on the strecht of road between Minneapolis and Saint Paul, because the station which records traffic is located approximately midway between there and records cars moving from east to west.

# [Project 3: Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data - finding the most popular brands and models](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Ebay%20Car%20Sales%20Data%20-%20finding%20the%20most%20popular%20brands%20and%20models.ipynb)
In this project we'll take a look at dataset of used cars from [eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/), a classifieds section of the German eBay website. Our dataset contains a lots of details about cars.

Our aim is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. We'll find most popular brands and models.

# [Project 2: Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/doxenix/projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts.ipynb)
In this project we will explor data from [Hacker News Posts](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

We will take a look at two types of posts whoes titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?". Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.
