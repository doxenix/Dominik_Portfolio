The project is devoted to free to download iOS and Android apps analysis. We assume, we're working for a company that builds Android and iOS apps and our aim is to find mobile app profiles which are profitable for App Store and Google Play markets.

We'll analyse free Android and iOS apps to find which apps categories are the most popular amoung useres and on this basis, we'll propose a type of app which may has the biggest chance to gain more popularity than another app profiles.
